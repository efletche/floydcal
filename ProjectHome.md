Project for UHM ICS 413

The calendar system maintains a minimalist to-do list for every day. Tasks are arranged in order of importance with time sensitive tasks, or "events" at the top of the list (in temporal order), location sensitive "errands" with second priority and flexible tasks (that can be done anytime, anywhere) at the bottom of the list. Lists can be edited dynamically, and are sorted dynamically.
